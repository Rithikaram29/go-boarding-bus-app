## Description

Go Boarding is a bus ticket booking platform designed to connect bus operators with customers looking to book bus tickets online. The platform offers two distinct interfaces, one for customers and one for bus operators (admin).

- Customer Interface: The customer side allows users to easily search for available buses based on their travel preferences, such as route, date, and time. Once they find suitable options, customers can securely book their tickets through the platform. Additionally, customers can view a list of their current bookings, as well as cancel any tickets they no longer need, directly from their user account.

- Admin Interface: The admin side is designed for bus operators who manage their bus fleets and schedule trips. Operators can log in using their credentials to add new buses to the system, create trips for existing buses, and manage ticket availability for specific trips. The admin can also view a detailed list of customers who have booked tickets for their buses, and if necessary, reset the ticket availability for any given trip, allowing them to manage bookings more efficiently.
